## How It Works

Starting with version Spotify++, the app intercepts Spotify requests to load user data, deserializes it, and modifies the parameters in real-time. This method is highly stable and effective, allowing users to select the dynamic Premium patching method in the Spotify++ settings.

Upon login, Spotify fetches user data and caches it in the `offline.bnk` file located in the `/Library/Application Support/PersistentCache` directory. It stores data in its proprietary binary format, including a length byte before each value and other conventions. Keys such as `player-license`, `financial-product`, `streaming-rules`, and others determine the user's capabilities.

The tweak patches this file during initialization; Spotify then loads it, assuming the user has Premium access. However, due to challenges with dynamic length and varied bytes, actual patching may not occur. The tweak extracts the username from the current `offline.bnk` file and inserts it into `premiumblank.bnk`, a file containing all preset premium values, replacing `offline.bnk`. If Spotify reloads user data, the user may be switched to the Free plan, triggering a popup with options to quickly restart the app and reset data.

Additionally, the tweak sets `trackRowsEnabled` in `SPTFreeTierArtistHubRemoteURLResolver` to `true`, enabling Spotify to load not just track names on the artist page. While this functionality can cease, similar to Spotilife, it remains effective on the latest Spotify 8.9## versions. (Spotilife also modifies `offline.bnk`, but changes obscure bytes that have no effect on newer versions).

## Spotify Tweaks Development

### Enhanced Model and AudioPlayer

First, let's improve our `Song` model to include more properties like `fileURL` for playing audio and `isPlaying` for tracking the current playing state:

```swift
struct Song {
    let id: Int
    let title: String
    let artist: String
    let album: String
    let duration: Int // in seconds
    let artwork: String // image name or URL
    let fileURL: URL // URL to audio file
    var isPlaying: Bool = false
}
```

Next, let's update our `AudioPlayer` class to support more advanced audio playback features using `AVPlayer`:

```swift
import AVFoundation

class AudioPlayer {
    static let shared = AudioPlayer()
    private var player: AVPlayer?
    private var currentSong: Song?
    
    func play(song: Song) {
        if currentSong?.id == song.id {
            // If the same song is already playing, toggle play/pause
            if player?.rate == 0 {
                player?.play()
            } else {
                player?.pause()
            }
        } else {
            // Play a new song
            currentSong = song
            player = AVPlayer(url: song.fileURL)
            player?.play()
            
            // Update the isPlaying state of the song
            song.isPlaying = true
        }
    }
    
    func pause() {
        player?.pause()
        if let song = currentSong {
            song.isPlaying = false
        }
    }
    
    func stop() {
        player?.pause()
        player = nil
        if let song = currentSong {
            song.isPlaying = false
        }
    }
    
    func seek(to time: TimeInterval) {
        player?.seek(to: CMTime(seconds: time, preferredTimescale: 1))
    }
}
```

### SwiftUI Views and Playback Controls

Now, let's enhance our SwiftUI views to include playback controls (play/pause, seek bar):

```swift
import SwiftUI
import AVFoundation

struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var songs: [Song] = [
        Song(id: 1, title: "Song 1", artist: "Artist A", album: "Album X", duration: 180, artwork: "song1", fileURL: Bundle.main.url(forResource: "song1", withExtension: "mp3")!),
        Song(id: 2, title: "Song 2", artist: "Artist B", album: "Album Y", duration: 200, artwork: "song2", fileURL: Bundle.main.url(forResource: "song2", withExtension: "mp3")!)
        // Add more songs as needed
    ]
    
    @State private var isPlaying = false
    @State private var currentSong: Song?
    @State private var currentTime: TimeInterval = 0
    @State private var duration: TimeInterval = 0
    
    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            VStack {
                if let song = currentSong {
                    VStack {
                        Image(song.artwork)
                            .resizable()
                            .aspectRatio(contentMode: .fit)
                            .frame(width: 200, height: 200)

We extend our sincere appreciation to the individuals and teams whose dedication and effort made the Spotify++ project possible. Their contributions have been invaluable:

- **EeveeSpotify:** Reverse-engineered Spotilife, employing techniques such as intercepting Spotify requests to develop this tweak.
- **SpotCompiled/SpotC-Plus-Plus:** Facilitated the compilation and accessibility of Spotilife + Sposify IPA files.
- **iTweaked Store:** Provided the official Spotify++ IPA for direct download.
